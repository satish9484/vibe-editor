## HuggingFace Free Tier

### What's Included for Free:

- ✅ Inference API with community models (like StarCoder)
- ✅ Unlimited requests (subject to rate limits)

### Rate Limits (Free Tier):

- Requests per minute are limited (varies by model)
- Some models may have a loading time on first use
- No hard cost limits - just rate limiting

## Model Priority & Auto-Fallback

Your API automatically tries models in this order:

1. `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324` (may require paid)
2. `bigcode/starcoder2-15b` ✅ Free fallback
3. `bigcode/starcoder2-7b` ✅ Free fallback
4. `bigcode/starcoder2-3b` ✅ Free fallback
